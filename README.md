# Meeps Background


Just shit i use on my discord.
this is pretty much just a slight tweak to LeafyLuigi's Pyrite, a great theme. 
I tweaked colors a little, and added an animated background. 

Go check out the original: https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/pyrite

## Extra
If you want to use a different background, you can just edit the "VideoBackground.config.json" file and change the line with "videoLink" to a url of whatever you want. I provide 2 easy setup videos, with the links of: 

https://github.com/KillaMeep/discordfiles/blob/main/GalaxyFloat.mp4?raw=true (the default one)

https://github.com/KillaMeep/discordfiles/blob/main/background-option2.gif?raw=true (the alt background)

If you want another background hosted, add my discord and I can set that up for you.
