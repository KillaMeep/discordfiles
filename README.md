# Meeps Background


Just shit i use on my discord.
this is pretty much just a slight tweak to LeafyLuigi's Pyrite, a great theme. 
I tweaked colors a little, and added an animated background. 

Go check out the original: https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/pyrite


## Extra
If you want to use a different background, you can just edit the "VideoBackground.config.json" file and change the line with "videoLink" to a url of whatever you want.
